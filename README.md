What is RDBMS?
RDBMS is an acronym for 'Relational Database Management System.'  A relational database is exactly what it sounds like -- it allows databases to connect and data to be compared
or compiled between databases.  Data is stored in a table structure, which lends itself to these comparisons/compilations.

What is SQL?
SQL is an acronym for "Structured Query Language."  SQL is a language that allows a user to write queries to call up specific columns of data from multiple differents tables
within a database.
